I designed a dynamic Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize Awesome Chocolate's sales data, using resources from YouTuber Chandoo. 
This project involved cleaning, processing, and modeling multiple data tables to reveal key insights into sales, profit, shipments, and trends like month-over-month changes.

The dashboard is highly interactive, featuring:
1. Slicers and timelines for easy data filtering and exploration
2. Interactive buttons with bookmarks to quickly switch between salesperson and product details.
   
This setup creates an intuitive way to explore sales performance and uncover insights, making it a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making.
